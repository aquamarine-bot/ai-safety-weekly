### [Pushing the Frontier of Black-Box LVLM Attacks via Fine-Grained Detail Targeting (M-Attack-V2)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17645)
- **Authors:** Xiaohan Zhao, Zhaoyi Li, Yaxin Luo et al.
- **Date:** 2026-02-19
- **Category:** `adversarial attack AND language model`

> Black-box adversarial attacks on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are challenging due to missing gradients and complex multimodal boundaries. We find that prior approaches induce high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semanti...

**📝 Summary:** M-Attack-V2：改进黑盒多模态 LLM 对抗攻击，通过 MCA+ATA 稳定梯度估计，Claude-4.0 攻击成功率 8%→30%，GPT-5 98%→100%。

### [Mind the GAP: Text Safety Does Not Transfer to Tool-Call Safety in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16943)
- **Authors:** Arnold Cartagena, Ariane Teixeira
- **Date:** 2026-02-18
- **Category:** `jailbreak AND agent`

> Large language models deployed as agents increasingly interact with external systems through tool calls--actions with real-world consequences that text outputs alone do not carry. Safety evaluations, however, overwhelmingly measure text-level refusal behavior, leaving a critical question unanswered: does alignment that suppresses harmful text also ...

**📝 Summary:** 提出 GAP benchmark，发现 LLM agent 的文本层拒绝≠工具调用层安全——模型口头拒绝的同时可能悄悄执行禁止操作，17,420 个数据点覆盖六个前沿模型。

### [Policy Compiler for Secure Agentic Systems (PCAS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16708)
- **Authors:** Nils Palumbo, Sarthak Choudhary, Jihye Choi et al.
- **Date:** 2026-02-18
- **Category:** `prompt injection`

> LLM-based agents are increasingly being deployed in contexts requiring complex authorization policies. Embedding these policies in prompts provides no enforcement guarantees. We present PCAS, a Policy Compiler for Agentic Systems that provides deterministic policy enforcement. PCAS models the agentic system state as a dependency graph capturing cau...

**📝 Summary:** PCAS：用 dependency graph + Datalog 策略语言实现确定性策略执行，防御 prompt injection，policy 合规率从 48% 提升到 93%，无需修改 agent 代码。

### [Helpful to a Fault: Measuring Illicit Assistance in Multi-Turn, Multilingual LLM Agents (STING)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16346)
- **Authors:** Nivya Talokar, Ayush K Tarun, Murari Mandal et al.
- **Date:** 2026-02-18
- **Category:** `red teaming AND LLM`

> LLM-based agents execute real-world workflows via tools and memory. These affordances enable ill-intended adversaries to also use these agents to carry out complex misuse scenarios. We introduce STING (Sequential Testing of Illicit N-step Goal execution), an automated red-teaming framework that constructs a step-by-step illicit plan grounded in a b...

**📝 Summary:** STING：自动化多轮 agent red-teaming 框架，将攻击建模为 time-to-first-jailbreak 随机变量，多语言实验发现低资源语言未必更脆弱（与 chatbot 研究结论不同）。

### [A Trajectory-Based Safety Audit of Clawdbot (OpenClaw)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14364)
- **Authors:** Tianyu Chen, Dongrui Liu, Xia Hu et al.
- **Date:** 2026-02-16
- **Category:** `agent safety`

> Clawdbot is a self-hosted, tool-using personal AI agent with a broad action space spanning local execution and web-mediated workflows. We present a trajectory-centric evaluation of Clawdbot across six risk dimensions. Our test suite samples and lightly adapts scenarios from prior agent-safety benchmarks (including ATBench and LPS-Bench) and supplem...

**📝 Summary:** 对 OpenClaw（Clawdbot）做 trajectory-based 安全审计，34 个测试用例覆盖六个风险维度，发现大多数失败出现在意图模糊或 benign-seeming jailbreak 场景。

### [Boundary Point Jailbreaking of Black-Box LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15001)
- **Authors:** Xander Davies, Giorgi Giglemiani, Edmund Lau et al.
- **Date:** 2026-02-16
- **Category:** `red teaming AND LLM`

> Frontier LLMs are safeguarded against attempts to extract harmful information via adversarial prompts known as "jailbreaks". Recently, defenders have developed classifier-based systems that have survived thousands of hours of human red teaming. We introduce Boundary Point Jailbreaking (BPJ), a new class of automated jailbreak attacks that evade the...

**📝 Summary:** BPJ：纯黑盒 jailbreak，每次只用一 bit 信息（是否被检测器标记），通过 curriculum 中间目标攻破 Constitutional Classifiers 和 GPT-5 输入过滤器。

### [Exposing the Systematic Vulnerability of Open-Weight Models to Prefill Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14689)
- **Authors:** Lukas Struppek, Adam Gleave, Kellin Pelrine
- **Date:** 2026-02-16
- **Category:** `red teaming AND LLM`

> Open-weight models natively support prefilling, which allows an attacker to predefine initial response tokens before generation begins. We present the largest empirical study to date of prefill attacks, evaluating over 20 existing and novel strategies across multiple model families and state-of-the-art open-weight models. Our results show that pref...

**📝 Summary:** 系统研究 prefill attack（预填充初始回复 token）对开源模型的攻击效果，20+ 策略评估全部主流开源模型，发现普遍脆弱；推理模型对通用 prefill 有一定抵抗但针对性策略依然有效。

### [SkillJect: Automating Stealthy Skill-Based Prompt Injection for Coding Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14211)
- **Authors:** Xiaojun Jia, Jie Liao, Simeng Qin et al.
- **Date:** 2026-02-15
- **Category:** `prompt injection`

> Agent skills are becoming a core abstraction in coding agents, packaging long-form instructions and auxiliary scripts to extend tool-augmented behaviors. This abstraction introduces an under-measured attack surface: skill-based prompt injection, where poisoned skills can steer agents away from user intent and safety policies. We propose the first a...

**📝 Summary:** SkillJect：首个针对 coding agent skill 的自动化隐蔽 prompt injection 框架，三 agent 闭环（Attack/Code/Evaluate），将恶意操作藏于辅助脚本中。

### [Unsafer in Many Turns: Benchmarking and Defending Multi-Turn Safety Risks in Tool-Using Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13379)
- **Authors:** Xu Li, Simon Yu, Minzhou Pan et al.
- **Date:** 2026-02-13
- **Category:** `agent safety`

> LLM-based agents are becoming increasingly capable, yet their safety lags behind. This creates a gap between what agents can do and should do. This gap widens as agents engage in multi-turn interactions and employ diverse tools, introducing new risks overlooked by existing benchmarks. To systematically scale safety testing into multi-turn, tool-rea...

**📝 Summary:** 构建 MT-AgentRisk benchmark（首个多轮工具调用 agent 安全评估），发现多轮场景下 ASR 平均提升 16%；提出免训练防御 ToolShield。Bo Li 组的工作！
